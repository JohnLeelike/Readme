### Overview and Origin
---
Ripple was conceived by Jed McCaleb and built by Arthur Britto and David Schwartz who then approached Ryan Fugger. Fugger had developed a system called OpenCoin which would transform into Ripple, a real-time gross settlement system, currency exchange and remittance network created by Ripple Labs Inc. The company also created its own form of digital currency referred to as XRP to allow financial institutions to transfer money with negligible fees and wait-time. Initially resleased in 2012, the technology was adopted by several banks as a messaging and payment system. It has recieved scrutiny from the SEC over raising over $1 billion in funds from investors by selling it's XRP token which is described as an unregistered security.
### Business Activities

The major financial problem Ripple is trying to solve is how payments are transacted between banks. The banking system currently uses a payment network called SWIFT which can be slow and is opague. Ripple's payment network which is based on a blockchain-like protocol is much more transparent, secure, and fast which many view as an improvement on the current system, even though it is not fully decentralized. The size of the market that Ripple is disrupting is in the quadrillions of dollars per year. According the US Treasury, SWIFT handles about $5 trillion per day, or given about 250 business days per year, about $1.25 quadrillion dollars a year. Similarly, CHIPS handles about $400 trillion per year, and Fedwire handles around $900 trillion per year (most of both of these arise out of SWIFT messages). These transactions make up a large fraction of electronic transactions in the world, so it's safe to assume that the global total isn't much more than a few quadrillion dollars a year. There is plenty to gain for Ripple / XRP.

The main technology Ripple offers that it's competitors don't is blockchain. It has it's own unique consensus protocol which ensures that payments aren't double-spent:

>Trust-Based Validation
>
>The core principle behind the XRP Ledger's consensus mechanism is that a little trust goes a long way. Each
>participant in the network chooses a set of validators, servers specifically configured to participate actively in
>consensus, run by different parties who are expected to behave honestly most of the time. More importantly, the set
>of chosen validators should not be likely to collude with one another to break the rules in the exact same way. This
>list is sometimes called a Unique Node List, or UNL.
>
>As the network progresses, each server listens to its trusted validatorsÂ³; as long as a large enough percentage of
>them agree that a set of transactions should occur and that a given ledger is the result, the server declares a
>consensus. If they don't agree, validators modify their proposals to more closely match the other validators they
>trust, repeating the process in several rounds until they reach a consensus.
